## Rastervision: Trust the Process
1. What is the overall aim of the project and what specific Earth Observation is it trying to solve?
  Rastervision had the following goals: run rastervision quickstart, run rastervision example(s), run rastervision on personal data. Our group and different reasons for using rastervision but ultimately, the goal was to complete semantic segmentation for urban tree canopy and fairy ring fungus in cranberry bogs.

4. Did the results show that the project aim was realized? Was an Earth Observation limit pushed back (or potentially pushed back)? If this was a group project, how were the results of individual efforts integrated? 
5. What are potential improvements, and any next steps you plan to take?
